<h2><i>by<br />
Tom W. Harris</i></h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">It was Orley</span> Mattup's killing
of the old lab technician
that really made us hate him.</p>

<p>Mattup was a guard at the reactor
installation at Bayless, Kentucky,
where my friend Danny
Hern and I were part of the staff
when the Outsiders took everything
over. In what god-forsaken mountain
hole they had found Mattup,
and how they got him to sell out
to them, I don't know. He was an
authentic human, though. You can
tell an Outsider.</p>

<p>Mattup and Danny and I were
playing high-low-jack the night
Uncle Pete was killed, sitting on
the widewalk where Mattup had a
view of the part of the station he
was responsible for. High-low-jack
is a back-country card game;
Danny had learned it in northern
Pennsylvania, where he came from,
and Mattup loved the game, and
they had taught it to me because
the game is better three-handed.
The evening sessions had been
Danny's idea&mdash;I think he figured
it might give him a line on Mattup.</p>

<p>On the night in question, Mattup
was on a week's losing streak
and was in a foul humor. He was
superstitious, and he had called for
a new deck twice that evening and
walked around his seat four different
times. His bidding was getting
wilder.</p>

<p>"You'd better cool down," Danny
told him. "Thing to do is ride
out the bad luck, not fight it."</p>

<p>Orley picked his nose and looked
at his cards, "Bid four," he
growled.</p>

<p>Four is the highest possible bid.
Tim played his cards well and he
had good ones. He had sewed up
three of his points when we heard
somebody moving around down on
the reactor floor. It was old Uncle
Pete Barker, one of the technicians.</p>

<div class="figc"><img src="images/001.png" width="600" height="538" alt="" title="" /></div>

<p>"What you want down there?"
bawled Mattup.</p>

<p>"Just left my cap by the control
room," said Uncle Pete, "and
thought I'd go get it."</p>

<p>"You keep the hell away from
there," grunted Mattup.</p>

<p>Uncle Pete stopped and stood
gazing up at us. We went on playing.
It was the last card of the
hand, and would either win the
game for Mattup or lose it for him.
Orley slapped his card down; it
was a crucial card, the jack. Danny
took it with a queen and Mattup
had lost the game.</p>

<p>I felt like clearing out. Mattup's
face was purple and his eyes looked
like wolves' eyes. He glared at
Danny, making a noise in his
throat, and then I saw his gaze
leave Danny and go to something
down by the reactor.</p>

<p>It was Uncle Pete, shuffling
along toward the control room.</p>

<p>Mattup didn't say a word. He
stood up and unholstered the thing
the Outsiders had given him and
pointed it at Uncle Pete. There
was a ringing in our ears and Uncle
Pete began to twist. Something inside
him twisted him, twisting inside
his arms, his legs, head, trunk,
even his fingers. It was only for
a few seconds. Then the ringing
stopped, and Uncle Pete sunk to
the ground, and there was the
silence and the smell.</p>

<p>Mattup made us leave the body
there until we had played two more
hands. Danny won one; he was a
man with good nerves. When we
were back in our room he said,
"That did it&mdash;I'm going to get
that guy."</p>

<p>"I hate his big thick guts," I
said, buttoning my pajama shirt,
"but how are you going to get
him?"</p>

<p>"I'll get him," said Danny.
"Meanwhile, we'll keep playing
cards."</p>

<p>Things went on almost normally
at the Bayless reactor. It was a
privately-owned pool-type reactor,
and we were sent samples of all
sorts of material for irradiation
from all over the country. Danny
was one of the irradiation men; I
generally handled controlling. The
Outsiders had filled the place with
telescreens and guards, and all mail
was opened, but there was no real
interference with the work. I began
to worry a little about Danny.
Almost every afternoon he spent
an hour alone in our room, with
the door closed.</p>

<p>Mattup kept getting worse; an
animal with power. He used to go
hunting with the damnable Outsider
weapon, although the meat
killed with it wasn't fit to eat,
and he used it on birds until there
wasn't one left anywhere near the
plant. He never killed a bluebird,
though. He said it was bad luck.
Sometimes he drank moonshine
corn liquor, usually alone, because
the Outsiders wouldn't touch it,
but sometimes he made some of
us drink with him, watching sharply
to see we didn't poison him and
craftily picking his nose. When
he was drunk he was abusive.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">One night</span> we were in our
room, dead for sleep after a
long game, and Danny said, "Let
me show you something."</p>

<p>He shuffled the cards, I cut, and
he dealt me an ace, king, queen,
jack, ten and deuce of spades. He
shuffled again and dealt me the
same in hearts.</p>

<p>"Watch as closely as you can,"
he grinned. "See if you can catch
me."</p>

<p>I couldn't.</p>

<p>"I've been practicing," he said.
"I'm going to get Mattup."</p>

<p>"What good will it do to beat
him in cards? You'll only make
him sore." I was relieved to learn
what Danny had been doing, alone
in our room, but this card-sharp
angle didn't make much sense to
me.</p>

<p>"Who says I'm going to beat
him at cards?" smiled Danny. "By
the way, did you hear the rumor?
They're going to break up the
staff, Outsider policy, send us to
Oak Ridge, Argonne, Shippingport,
send new people down here."</p>

<p>"That doesn't leave you much
time," I said.</p>

<p>"Time enough," said Danny.</p>

<p>The next night Mattup began
a fantastic streak of luck. It seemed
he couldn't lose, and he was as
unpleasant a winner as he was a
loser.</p>

<p>"You boys don't know what card-playin'
is," he'd gloat. "Think
you're pretty smarty with all that
science stuff but you can't win a
plain old card game. You know
why you can't beat me, boys?"</p>

<p>"Because you're too smart, I
guess," said Danny.</p>

<p>"Well, yeah, and somethin' else.
I dipped my hands in spunk water,
up on the mountain where you
can never find it, and besides that
I spit on ever' card in this deck
and wiped it off. Couldn't lose now
to save my life."</p>

<p>"Maybe you're right," said Danny,
and went on dealing.</p>

<p>In a few days the rumor of
moving was confirmed; I was being
sent to Oak Ridge, Danny to
Argonne. Mattup kept winning,
and "suggested" that we raise the
stakes. By the day that we were
to leave we owed him every cent
we had.</p>

<p>I paid up soberly; I wouldn't
give Mattup any satisfaction by
complaining. It looked as though
Danny wasn't going to "get" Mattup
after all. But Danny surprised
me.</p>

<p>"Look, buster," he wheedled.
"If I pay you seventy-five bucks
I won't have a cent left. How
about me paying half now and the
rest later?"</p>

<p>"No good," said Mattup. "You
got it&mdash;pay me. If you can't pay
cash gimme your watch. I know
you got one."</p>

<p>"Look, buster&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Quit callin' me buster."</p>

<p>"What am I going to live on until
I get paid again?"</p>

<p>"What do I care?"</p>

<p>It went on like that until the
busses for the airport were nearly
ready to leave and both men
seemed angry enough to kill each
other.</p>

<p>"Let's go," I begged Danny.
"Pay him and leave."</p>

<p>"All right then!" Danny snapped,
and pulled out his wallet. He
counted out all his bills into Mattup's
hand.</p>

<p>"You're a buck short," said
Mattup.</p>

<p>"Why not forget the buck?"
said Danny. "You can spare it."</p>

<p>"You're a buck short," repeated
Mattup, scowling.</p>

<p>Danny dashed his wallet to the
ground. "You're even taking my
change!" He got his jacket from
the back of a chair&mdash;it was a hot
day&mdash;and emptied change from the
side pocket.</p>

<p>There were two quarters and a
half dollar, and he paid them over.
"I have eleven cents left," he said.
"Hell, take that too. I don't give
a damn."</p>

<p>Mattup grinned. "Sure I'll take
it&mdash;if you weren't lying when you
said I could have it."</p>

<p>"It'll break me," said Danny.</p>

<p>"I know it," said Mattup.
"Gonna break your promise?"</p>

<p>The bus driver was honking.
"The hell with you," Danny said
to Mattup, and gave him a dime
and a penny. He looked Mattup in
the eye with a strange expression.
"Now, I gave you that and you
didn't win it. You took it of your
own free will. I offered it to you
and you took it. Right?"</p>

<p>"Right," said Mattup. "Sucker."</p>

<p>We scrambled on the bus and
as it pulled away Danny yelled
"Hey, Buster, look!" Mattup
looked, and Danny stuck his right
arm out the window, pointing at
Mattup with his right forefinger
and his little finger stuck out
straight and parallel, the thumb
tucked under. A strange, disturbed
look came over Orley. He turned
his back as the bus roared out of
the drive.</p>

<p>At the airport Danny popped
into a phone-booth and got Orley
on the line&mdash;nobody seemed to
care, either Outsiders or guards&mdash;and
he let me listen.</p>

<p>"Spent your money yet, dead
man?" purred Danny.</p>

<p>"Whacha mean, dead man?"
gruffed Orley's voice. "You crazy
or something?"</p>

<p>"You know that eleven cents extra
you took?" gloated Danny.
"It's gonna kill you, Buster, for
killing Uncle Pete, and for everything
else you've done. I know. I've
been talking nights to Uncle Pete.
You're a dead duck, Orley Mattup!
Dead!"</p>

<p>"That's&mdash;I don't believe it, it's
baloney! I'm going to spend that
eleven cents and get rid of it."</p>

<p>"You do exactly that, Buster. I
locked the curse on it, and I made
the sign on you, and you have to
keep that eleven cents the rest of
your life. If you spend it&mdash;or if
you lose it, and you will lose it&mdash;that's
the end of you."</p>

<p>"I'll come out there and pound
the hell out of you!" yelled Mattup.</p>

<p>"Too late, Buster, our planes are
leaving. Goodbye, dead man!"</p>

<p>And we had to run for our planes.
Danny's pitch sounded pretty weak
to me, even though Orley was superstitious,
but I didn't get to tell
Danny that until nearly five years
later.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"I&nbsp;think</span> I got him," said Danny.
"You don't know the whole thing."</p>

<p>A hotel clerk had been listening.
"You mean Orley Mattup, the
guard? He got sick, and said he
had a hex on him, and took off
one day and a lot later they found
him up on the mountain. He was
dead."</p>

<p>"Any money on him?" asked
Danny.</p>

<p>"Jest some change. They buried
it with him; they heard the hex
was locked onto that money."</p>

<p>"Congratulations," I told Danny.
"I didn't think it'd work. You
scared him to death."</p>

<p>"Not quite," said Danny. "I
scared him into hanging onto the
money. That money would have
killed anybody that carried it much
longer than the few minutes I handled
it. I'd been keeping the stuff
in the reactor beam tubes. It was
radioactive as hell."</p>
